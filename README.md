# Fredtun
This is the code for the camp site [Fredtun](http://fredtunleirsted.no). It uses Gridsome in the frontend,
which fetches the content from sanity.io using graphql. 
 
## Build
* If you do not have the Gridsome CLI tool available, you can install it by running ```npm install -g @gridsome/cli```

* ```gridsome develop``` starts a local dev server with file watching.

* ```gridsome build``` builds the site
